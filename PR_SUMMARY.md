# 🍳 Transform Microblog into Recipe Sharing Platform

## Summary
This PR completely transforms the Flask microblog application into "Foody" - a comprehensive recipe sharing platform. The transformation maintains the core architecture while reimagining the user experience for recipe discovery, creation, and management.

## 🎯 Key Changes

### **Core Transformation**
- **Renamed `Post` → `Recipe`** with backward compatibility
- **Added recipe-specific fields**: title, description, ingredients (JSON), instructions, prep/cook times, servings, difficulty, category, image URL
- **Updated database schema** with new migration
- **Maintained existing functionality** (user management, authentication, following)

### **New Features**
- **Recipe creation page** (`/share`) with comprehensive form
- **Recipe detail pages** (`/recipe/<id>`) with full recipe information
- **Recipe editing** (`/recipe/<id>/edit`) with authorization checks
- **Smart ingredient system** - structured JSON storage with user-friendly text input
- **Restructured navigation** - home shows all recipes, dedicated share button

### **User Experience**
- **Beautiful recipe cards** with collapsible ingredients/instructions
- **Professional recipe display** with metadata (prep time, servings, difficulty)
- **Responsive design** optimized for all devices
- **Intuitive navigation** with contextual edit buttons for recipe authors

### **Security & Authorization**
- **Recipe editing restricted** to recipe authors only
